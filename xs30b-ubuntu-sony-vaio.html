External devices do not work (however the keyboards function keys work, along with the sony vaios assist/web/vaio buttons). 
During my installation of Linux on a laptop I set a Secure Boot password. Everything worked perfectly, but now I want to change the Secure Boot password. The internet is filled with guides to solve lost Secure Boot password issues, and to disable it. I know the password, I just want to change the password. I can enter the UEFI settings. There is "Set Machine Password", but I don't think that's it. There is also "Secure Boot Key Management", but I don't think that's it either. Ubuntu;.

As the year 2017 comes to an end, it’s time to find out which Linux distributions are most popular. However, the news of the Linux world at the Desktop level was not very surprising, while in the segment of Internet of Things,Blockchain and Cloud, Linux has been one of the systems in the spotlight. “We don’t want to be a single OS manufacturer, I don’t think it’s a viable position in the long term.” ( Sony in regards to selling Android mobile devices. Now they want to also sell Windows mobile. Considering the history of their desktop/laptop systems, I question the sincerity of this statement. Почему выбирают нас ? Всё очень просто!

I have just switched to Ubuntu 13.04 from Windows 8 and I'm very new to this OS. When I put the computer to sleep (suspend) by closing my laptop lid, it seems that all it does is shutting the compu. help!!!! Здравствуйте, у меня стоит 8 винда.

My sister is visiting and wants to dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 7. I figured it'd be easy - easier than Windows 8 was on my Asus. However, I wanted to accomplish two things. 1. To let her play around with a live version before taking the plunge. However, even changing the boot order in the BIOS settings won't boot into the live USB. 2. If she decides to take the plunge, then setting up a dual boot. I don't know why it won't boot into the USB after being selected. Something to do with Insyde.

Hi - Does anyone know of a program i can use to darken my screen? Brightnesscontroller used to do it, but it isnt for 15.04 as far as i can tell (not in the software center). I dont want a color temperature change, i want to darken my screen beyond normal limits. Thanks. Gaikai (外海, lit. "open sea", i.e. an expansive outdoor space) is an American company which provides technology for the streaming of high-end video games. Founded in 2008, it was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment I am very pleased with ubuntu. I have been using linux for 10 years now and have been using ubuntu since warty. I have got my parents and my girlfriend to use ubuntu as well. My girlfriend just got a new laptop, a sony vaio e series, and I tried installing 10.04 on it. There were some issues, no sound, unresponsive trackpad, and no wireless. She really wanted to keep the laptop as she is a journalist and buys things according to how well the keyboard fits her hands. I tried many things. My laptop, Sony Vaio vgn-ns205n, dual boot: windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04LTS seems to be having a external mouse/touchpad issue: - either both don't work, or one works and not the other, or works temporarily. I'm currently running windows 7. It has suggested to download new drivers for Intel ich9 Family Universal Host Controller: - 2934 - 2935 - 2936 - 2937 - 2938 - 2939 - 293A - 293C - USB Composite Device - USB Root Hub (a few by the same name) I've gone to Intel's driver download website. 
Hi. I wrote very small script for off/on touchpad. Maybe somebody will find this useful. https://gist.github.com/7histle/24870cd5a7bc513042c5. OK, so I know this isn't ubuntuforums, but I was wondering whether I could have better luck here. When I tried running Ubuntu 10.04 on my Sony VAIO CW (VPCCW21FX), which has an NVIDIA GeForce 310M video card, the screen would go black right after the Ubuntu loading screen. Seems that the default drivers in 10.04 do not support this video card. In 9.10, I was able to work around this by plugging into another monitor, and editing the driver file to include the laptop monitor. However I'm a fan of the quality of a Macbook, but I don't like the price or the culture. Who else makes a legitimately high quality laptop? I'm sick of shitty Dell-type laptops. I have a Sony Vaio VGN-NW125J that I bought about 2.5 years ago. It works pretty darn well except for one big problem: when I move it, it completely freezes. I can't move the mouse, and there is no response when I hit the keys (except the hard drive LED lights up). I can't even turn it off by shutting it. The only option is to unplug it, remove the battery, and restart. This freezing problem is pretty idiosyncratic- sometimes I can move it without a problem, and sometimes the slightest. I have a desktop that I built, part suggestion courtesy of /r/buildapc, which is running Windows 7 satisfactorily. The Sony Vaio I have, the AR-550U ( is running Windows Vista. My primary worry for installing Ubuntu is for the drivers. Is there a way to run drivers in compatibility mode or the like in Ubuntu? If so, how? I'd like to have something other than Vista on this old laptop of mine, but I want to take advan. 
Ok, so I was going to use this for a home camera network, but now got my hands in a NVR, so I think I am going to set up a pihole instead. With kids getting older and my detest for ads and shit cripling my network, I need more security at home. I also want access to stuff remotely and want to make sure my holes are plugged. Here is my 2 hardware options. 1. Raspberry Pi 2b 2. Dell dimension 3000 Celeron 2.4ghz 512mb ram running Ubuntu server 18.04 3. SONY Laptop VAIO NR Series VGN-NR48. I had been using Ubuntu on my 8 year old Sony Vaio. System worked well for the past year. Have recently switched to Pop_OS because Ubuntu 19.04 was glitching. Pop 19.04 is working very well. I would like to install it on my 3 year old Dell Alienware 15 R2. Dell tech support tells me that it won’t work. Anybody out there tried I recently installed Ubuntu Mate 18.04 on my pretty old laptop: sony vaio vpcf1. When I try to open firefox,it doesn't open and it gives me a crash error. So basically I can't surf the internet so I can't do anything. Total budget and country of purchase: 0 post tax preferably, in Canada Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. I mostly just want it to be thin, decent quality build(metal?), if possible an OK screen for watching videos but that's not as important. I really just want it to be really light and mobile. How important is weight and thinness to you? As before, super important. I REALLY loved. TL;DR 1. Atom Compute Stick:  2. Desktop Gaming/Possible plex Backed: 0 3. Added costs of everything from chairs to desks to peripherals to demo the total cost of setting up ___ My eeePC with a 900MHz Celeron and 7” screen was starting to drive me nuts. I lurk around here enough that I decided: “I want a PC under 0 that can play some older games but mostly be used for basic internet shenanigans, LibreOffice, SNES Emulators, etc. After doing a “submit an Offer” TL;DR I think people think of computer technicians as annoying nerds until they need them to fix their computer. Many times I have thought this. People can't use computers, either. My social studies teachers computer shuts off. I was watching the screen at the time. We all were. It was connected to the projector. We were watching some YouTube video on George Washington when it shut off. She looks at the screen, then the computer, then back to the screen. She bends down, pushes the power. 
Although the title is everything I need to ask, here are some more details: 1. PC - Sony Vaio E series (4GB RAM, no graphic card); Dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu; I run AS on Ubuntu 18.0.4 2. I am learning to develop Android apps currently and do not require the latest updates, although maximum functionality with less stress on the CPU would be ideal 3. Developed 1 app on AS 3.1 last year but the emulator kept crashing; so ran the app on an old Android i had lying around 4. Installed the latest. Total budget and country of purchase: 00ish Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Yes, primarily looking for a 2 in 1 with good battery life. Foldable is preferred to detachable. How important is weight and thinness to you? Important. Obviously I don't need it to be sharp enough to cut vegetables, but something that I can easily carry around with me. Which OS do you require? Window.
